This dissertation would not have been possible without the help of many people in different ways.\\



First of all, I would like to thank Alessandro Giusti: since when we started \textit{playing}
with cell counting for the Image Analysis project, he has always been a rich and precious guide,
his suggestions are never trivial and always stimulating, his ability to produce a good snippet of code in zero time has always impressed me.
I owe him a great amount of experience.\\



I would like to thank my wife for giving me the chance to start working with biological images.\\



A special acknowledgment associates my wife, my mother and all the people I know for being so patient with me.\\




Finally, thanks to Leonardo... for being him.
