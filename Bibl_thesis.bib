  abstract = {This paper presents a novel and efficient facial image representation
	based on local binary pattern (LBP) texture features. The face image
	is divided into several regions from which the LBP feature distributions
	are extracted and concatenated into an enhanced feature vector to
	be used as a face descriptor. The performance of the proposed method
	is assessed in the face recognition problem under different challenges.
	Other applications and several extensions are also discussed},

  abstract = {We explore the problem of classifying images by the object categories
	they contain in the case of a large number of object categories.
	To this end we combine three ingredients: (i) shape and appearance
	representations that support spatial pyramid matching over a region
	of interest. This generalizes the representation of Lazebnik et al.,
	(2006) from an image to a region of interest (ROI), and from appearance
	(visual words) alone to appearance and local shape (edge distributions);
	(ii) automatic selection of the regions of interest in training.
	This provides a method of inhibiting background clutter and adding
	invariance to the object instance 's position; and (iii) the use
	of random forests (and random ferns) as a multi-way classifier. The
	advantage of such classifiers (over multi-way SVM for example) is
	the ease of training and testing. Results are reported for classification
	of the Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 data sets. We compare the performance
	of the random forest/ferns classifier with a benchmark multi-way
	SVM classifier. It is shown that selecting the ROI adds about 5%
	to the performance and, together with the other improvements, the
	result is about a 10% improvement over the state of the art for Caltech-256.},

	represented by its center pixel and a local difference sign-magnitude
	transform (LDSMT). The center pixels represent the image gray level
	and they are converted into a binary code, namely CLBP-Center (CLBP_C),
	by global thresholding. LDSMT decomposes the image local differences
	into two complementary components: the signs and the magnitudes,
	and two operators, namely CLBP-Sign (CLBP_S) and CLBP-Magnitude (CLBP_M),
	are proposed to code them. The traditional LBP is equivalent to the
	CLBP_S part of CLBP, and we show that CLBP_S preserves more information
	of the local structure than CLBP_M, which explains why the simple
	LBP operator can extract the texture features reasonably well. By
	combining CLBP_S, CLBP_M, and CLBP_C features into joint or hybrid
	distributions, significant improvement can be made for rotation invariant
	texture classification.},

  abstract = {<b>Background:</b> Segmentation of areas containing tumor cells in
	standard H&E histopathology images of breast (and several other tissues)
	is a key task for computer-assisted assessment and grading of histopathology
	slides. Good segmentation of tumor regions is also vital for automated
	scoring of immunohistochemical stained slides to restrict the scoring
	or analysis to areas containing tumor cells only and avoid potentially
	misleading results from analysis of stromal regions. Furthermore,
	detection of mitotic cells is critical for calculating key measures
	such as mitotic index; a key criteria for grading several types of
	cancers including breast cancer. We show that tumor segmentation
	can allow detection and quantification of mitotic cells from the
	standard H&E slides with a high degree of accuracy without need for
	special stains, in turn making the whole process more cost-effective.
	<b>Method:</b> Based on the tissue morphology, breast histology image
	contents can be divided into four regions: Tumor, Hypocellular Stroma
	(HypoCS), Hypercellular Stroma (HyperCS), and tissue fat (Background).
	Background is removed during the preprocessing stage on the basis
	of color thresholding, while HypoCS and HyperCS regions are segmented
	by calculating features using magnitude and phase spectra in the
	frequency domain, respectively, and performing unsupervised segmentation
	on these features. <b>Results:</b> All images in the database were
	hand segmented by two expert pathologists. The algorithms considered
	here are evaluated on three pixel-wise accuracy measures: precision,
	recall, and F1-Score. The segmentation results obtained by combining
	HypoCS and HyperCS yield high F1-Score of 0.86 and 0.89 with re­spect
	to the ground truth. <b>Conclusions:</b> In this paper, we show that
	segmentation of breast histopathology image into hypocellular stroma
	and hypercellular stroma can be achieved using magnitude and phase
	spectra in the frequency domain. The segmentation leads to demarcation
	of tumor margins leading to improved accuracy of mitotic cell detection.},

	used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies
	candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved

	for mitosis detection, comparing its performance to the classifications
	of three pathologists. The system's and the pathologists' classifications
	are based on evaluation of digital micrographs of hematoxylin and
	eosin stained breast tissue. On figures where the majority of pathologists
	agree on a classification, we compare the performance of the trained
	system to that of the individual pathologists. We find that the level
	of agreement of the pathologists ranges from slight to moderate,
	with strong biases, and that the system performs competitively in
	rating the ground truth set. This study is a step towards automatic
	mitosis count to accelerate a pathologist's work and improve reproducibility.

	major diseases such as breast cancer. Analysis of medical images
	largely remains the work of human experts. Current virtual microscope
	systems are mainly an emulation of real microscopes with annotation
	and some image analysis capabilities. However, the lack of effective
	knowledge management prevents such systems from being computer-aided
	prognosis platforms. The cognitive virtual microscopic framework,
	through an extended modeling and use of medical knowledge, has the
	capacity to analyse histopathological images and to perform grading
	of breast cancer, providing pathologists with a robust and traceable
